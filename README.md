# ChatGPT Search Engine

This simple Chrome Extension sets ChatGPT as your default search engine in Chrome. This is probably in violation of some ToS, so it's not going on the Extension store.

To install:

1. Clone this repository
2. Load it unpacked via `chrome://extensions` with Developer mode enabled

## Disclaimer

This software is provided as is, without warranty of any kind, something something, if SBF doesn't need a lawyer, neither do I. I do not endorse ChatGPT as a search engine. In fact, if this extension runs into an error, it ends up redirecting your query to Neeva, my preferred search engine.
